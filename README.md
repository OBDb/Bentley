## About Bentley Motors

Bentley Motors Limited is a British luxury automobile manufacturer founded by W.O. Bentley in 1919. Known for its high-performance grand tourers and luxury vehicles, Bentley has become synonymous with British craftsmanship, engineering excellence, and luxury motoring. The company has been a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group since 1998.

## Generations

### Early Years (1919-1931)

Bentley was founded in January 1919 by Walter Owen Bentley in Cricklewood, North London. The company quickly established its reputation through motorsport, winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans five times between 1924 and 1930. Early Bentley cars were known for their engineering quality and sporting capability, with models like the 3-Litre, 4Â½-Litre, and the iconic "Blower" Bentley.

### Rolls-Royce Era (1931-1998)

Following financial difficulties during the Great Depression, Bentley was acquired by Rolls-Royce in 1931. During this period, Bentley vehicles gradually evolved to share more components with Rolls-Royce models while maintaining a sportier character. Notable models from this era include the R-Type Continental, S-Series, T-Series, and Mulsanne. The Continental R, launched in 1991, marked a return to Bentley's sporting roots with its distinctive styling and powerful turbocharged engine.

### Volkswagen Group Era (1998-Present)

In 1998, Volkswagen AG acquired Bentley Motors. This acquisition led to significant investment in the brand, resulting in a renaissance for Bentley. The company expanded its model range and modernized its production facilities in Crewe, England. The Continental GT, introduced in 2003, became a cornerstone of the modern Bentley lineup, combining grand touring capabilities with luxury appointments. Other significant models include the Flying Spur, Bentayga SUV, and the flagship Mulsanne (2010-2020). In recent years, Bentley has announced plans for electrification, with hybrid models already in production and full electric vehicles in development.
